## Getting Started with Code Samples

This GitHub repository provides public access to code examples that demonstrate how to programmatically submit requests to the [pdfRest API Toolkit](https://pdfrest.com) service.

Start by [generating a free API Key](https://pdfrest.com/getstarted), required to run these samples. Choose between a Guest API Key for 50 free API Calls before signing up, or create an account with a Starter plan for 300 free API Calls per month. [Plans](https://pdfrest.com/pricing) scale up from there to support all projects and applications, big and small.

<br>

## Instructions for Running Code Samples

### Uploading an input file

POST requests require an API Key. To apply your API Key, you must include it in your requests as a header called `Api-Key`.

Before running each sample program, look for a comment that reads:

> `Place your api key here`

and replace `xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx` with your API Key.

### Downloading your output file(s)

Each subdirectory includes a `get-resource` sample that demonstrates how to download output files.

When you make a POST call to one of the API endpoints, you will receive back a response that includes an ID reference to each resource, including newly uploaded input files and newly generated output files. These IDs are in the form of a universally unique identifier (UUID).

Before running this sample program, look for a comment that reads:

> `place resource uuid here`

and replace `xxxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx` with the resource UUID you received back from a previous POST request. You may also wish to update the variable containing the output file name before sending your GET request.

### Running a sample program

Below are instructions for running a sample in each language included in this repository.

## API Documentation

After you've successfully sent an API Call using these examples, take a look at the [Documentation](https://pdfrest.com/documentation.html) for each API endpoint for a full description of parameters you can adjust to customize your solution.

<br>

## Postman Collection

Use Postman to fast-track your API testing! Check out the pdfRest [Postman Collection](https://www.postman.com/pdfrest/) to start sending POST requests with just a few clicks from pre-configured POST requests.

# In this sample, we will show how to take an encrypted file and decrypt, modify
# and re-encrypt it to create an encryption-at-rest solution as discussed in
# https://pdfrest.com/solutions/create-secure-document-workflows-with-pdf-password-protection/
# We will be running the document through /decrypted-pdf to open the document
# to modification, running the decrypted result through /pdf-with-added-image,
# and then sending the output with the new image through /encrypted-pdf to
# lock it up again.

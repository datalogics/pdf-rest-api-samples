# In this sample, we will show how to watermark a PDF document and then restrict
# editing on the document so that the watermark cannot be removed, as discussed in
# https://pdfrest.com/solutions/add-pdf-watermarks-that-cannot-be-removed/.
# We will be running the input file through /watermarked-pdf to apply the watermark
# and then /restricted-pdf to lock the watermark in.
